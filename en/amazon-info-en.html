      On this page, we have gathered important information about shipping, taxes, language and currency settings, and tips for saving costs when you buy from Amazon US and Amazon UK.
    </p><div class="note">
<strong>Important:</strong> The information on this page is general only. Prices, shipping terms, and fees change constantly. Always check the final price and the breakdown of taxes/fees on the Amazon checkout page before ordering.

<div class="section-title-small">Briefly about the sites we use</div>
<div class="chips">
<span class="chip">Amazon US</span>
<span class="chip">Amazon UK</span>
</div>
<p>
        For most products on our recommendation pages, you will find links to Amazon US or Amazon UK. Information about the shipping region (US / UK) also appears on the product card.
      </p>
</div><h2>Amazon US</h2><p>
      On Amazon US, many products are marked as:
      <strong>"FREE delivery to Israel on eligible orders over $49"</strong>.
    </p><ul>
<li>
        To reach the minimum of <strong>$49</strong> for free shipping, you can and should 
        assemble a cart from different brands and sellers – as long as it says next to each product that it 
        is included in free shipping over $49.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>Average shipping time:</strong> Usually around two weeks to Israel (sometimes more or less, depending on the product and the period).
      </li>
<li>
        Pay attention to <strong>Import Fees / Import Charges</strong> appearing at checkout – they are part of the final cost.
      </li>
</ul><h2>Amazon UK</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Average shipping time:</strong> Usually about a week, and sometimes even less.
      </li>
<li>
        On Amazon UK, generally, the larger the basket (more products together in the same order), 
        the <strong>average shipping cost per product decreases</strong>.
      </li>
<li>
        Here too, it is important to check the checkout page for the final shipping cost and the amount of 
        <strong>Import Charges</strong> (if any).
      </li>
</ul>
 Language and Currency Settings 
<h2>How to change language and currency on Amazon (US &amp; UK)</h2><div class="section-box">
<div class="section-title-small">Changing site language (Desktop)</div>
<ul>
<li>Log in to <strong>Amazon.com</strong> or <strong>Amazon.co.uk</strong> in your account.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for a <strong>flag / globe</strong> icon (Language / Country &amp; Region).</li>
<li>Click on it and select your preferred language (usually English). If a Hebrew option exists, it can also be selected.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section-box">
<div class="section-title-small">Changing currency to Shekels (ILS) – Desktop Site</div>
<ul>
<li>On the main page, scroll to the bottom of the page and look for a link like <strong>Change currency / ₪ ILS</strong> (usually next to the region settings).</li>
<li>Select <strong>ILS – Israeli Shekel</strong> and save.</li>
<li>
          In some cases, you will also find it through the menu: 
          <strong>Accounts &amp; Lists → Your Account → Ordering and shopping preferences → Change currency</strong>.
        </li>
</ul>
<p class="disclaimer">
        Even after changing the currency to Shekels, the final charge is made according to the exchange rates and clearing fees of the credit card company / Amazon – therefore it is always advisable to check the final amount in Shekels.
      </p>
</div><div class="section-box">
<div class="section-title-small">Changing language and currency in the Amazon app</div>
<ul>
<li>Open the app → click on the menu button (≡).</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Country &amp; Language</strong> and change the language and region (e.g., Israel / United States / United Kingdom).</li>
<li>In some versions, you can also select the Currency and choose ILS, and if not – prices will be displayed in Dollars / Pounds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
 Taxes in Israel 
<h2>Taxes, VAT, and Import Charges to Israel</h2><ul>
<li>
        As of today, for most orders up to <strong>approximately $150</strong> (including shipping, excluding insurance), 
        it is possible to avoid additional taxes, but: 
        <strong>Always</strong> important to read the explanation that appears on Amazon regarding 
        <em>Import Fees Deposit / Import Charges</em>.
      </li>
<li>
        Above this amount, VAT / additional taxes may apply – Amazon sometimes collects a 
        tax deposit (Import Fees Deposit) in advance and handles customs clearance for you.
      </li>
<li>
        Before confirming the order, check: 
        <strong>Product price + Shipping + Import Charges = Final Price</strong>.
      </li>
</ul>
 Product Variations / Changes 
<h2>Changes in products and prices</h2><p>
      On the product pages on our site, we present estimated price ranges and information correct as of the last update date. 
      On Amazon itself, information can change: price, volume, formula, packaging, shipping terms, and more.
    </p><ul>
<li>Always re-read the <strong>full product name</strong> and the <strong>details / description</strong> on the Amazon page.</li>
<li>Check the package size (ml / gr / fl oz) and match it to your expectations.</li>
<li>If something looks different from what is written here – rely on what appears <strong>on the Amazon site</strong> at the time of purchase.</li>
</ul>
 Affiliation 
<h2>Disclosure – Affiliate Links</h2><p class="disclaimer">
      Some of the product links on our site are <strong>affiliate links</strong>. 
      This means that if you make a purchase through the link – we may receive a small commission from Amazon, at no extra cost to you.

    </p>
 Savings Tips 
<h2>Tips for saving on shipping</h2><ul>
<li>
        Try to concentrate as many products as possible in one order – especially on Amazon UK, where 
        <strong>the average shipping cost per product decreases</strong> as the order amount increases.
      </li>
<li>
        Check if the same product exists in both US and UK – sometimes the difference in shipping or taxes 
        makes the difference.
      </li>
<li>
        Compare several products from the same brand to reach a cart above the free shipping amount 
        (e.g., above $49) without buying "just because".
      </li>
</ul>
